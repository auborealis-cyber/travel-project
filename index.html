        <h2>Why WAAAM?</h2>
        <h3>Hood River, Happiest City in the US</h3>
        <p>
WAAAM has one of the largest collections of still-flying antique aeroplanes and still-driving antique automobiles in the country.  The items on display at this museum are not only full of history, they're full of LIFE!  
<br>
At WAAAM you will enjoy our extensive collection of antique aircraft including the 1917 Curtiss JN-4D Jenny featuring an OX-5 90 HP engine, our Piper Cub and WACO collections, Aeronca collection, Stearman collection and many more fun aircraft. 
<br>
Don't forget the cars.  There are over 130 cars in the collection at last count.  Whether you want to see the 1914 Detroit Electric, a Ford Model A or Model T, a Packard, a Studebaker or even a Locomobile, you are sure to find your favorite. 
If motorcycles are your wheels of choice, we have you covered too! WAAAM has Harley Davidsons, Indians, Cushmans and more!
Aircraft, automobiles, motorcycles, tractors, military jeeps and engines all get their day in the sun again at WAAAM.
