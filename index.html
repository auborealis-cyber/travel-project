            <h3>Hood River, Happiest City in the US</h3>
            <p>
              WAAAM has one of the largest collections of still-flying antique
              aeroplanes and still-driving antique automobiles in the country.
              The items on display at this museum are not only full of history,
              they're full of LIFE!
              <br />

              Don't forget the cars. There are over 130 cars in the collection
              at last count. Whether you want to see the 1914 Detroit Electric,
              a Ford Model A or Model T, a Packard, a Studebaker or even a
              Locomobile, you are sure to find your favorite. If motorcycles are
              your wheels of choice, we have you covered too! WAAAM has Harley

                <h4>1914 Detroit Electric</h4>
            <p>Electric cars are over 100 years old! WAAAM’s Detroit Electric still has its original rechargeable lead acid batteries from the Edison Electric Company. Detroit Electrics were advertised to get 80 miles to the charge at speeds of 20-25 mph which was just right for the two most common types of electric car vehicle owners – doctors making house calls or ladies visiting friends and relatives.</p>

                <p>The New Standard D-25 was purpose built for barnstorming and “hopping” rides. A barnstormer’s dream, the D-25 was a star of the early airshows. It performed acrobatics slowly and gracefully, ably carried wing walkers and its front cockpit accommodated four passengers for joyrides.</p>
